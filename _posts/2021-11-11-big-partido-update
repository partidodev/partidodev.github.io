UI cleanup
We did some cleanup to get a more modern and refreshed app design. We hope you’ll love the clean materialistic interface that automatically switches to dark mode if your system switches to dark mode as well.

First release out of beta
The new app release 2.1.1 will be the first release of Partido out of the beta program. But of course, if you encounter any issues, please don’t hesitate to contact us to let us know whats missing. You can contact via our homepage or directly in the Partido app via the three dot menu.
