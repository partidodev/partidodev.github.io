In the past year there was not much activity on the Partido app but now you can download a new version with a lot of new cool features on [Google PlayStore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.fosforito.partido&pcampaignid=pcampaignidMKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-1)!

## Statistics

A new tab has been added to show quickly the expense trend for the past weeks and months with details about what categories the most money goes into.

## Forgot your password?

No problem! Now you can recover your account without needing to send us an email. This saves you time and everything you need is to have access to your registered email address.

## UI cleanup

We did some cleanup to get a more modern and refreshed app design. We hope you’ll love the clean materialistic interface that automatically switches to dark mode if your system switches to dark mode as well.

## First release out of beta

The new app release 2.1.1 will be the first release of Partido out of the beta program. But of course, if you encounter any issues, please don’t hesitate to contact us to let us know whats missing. You can contact via our homepage or directly in the Partido app via the three dot menu.
